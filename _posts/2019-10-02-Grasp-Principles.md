# Grasp's Principles In Your Own Words

### Creator
Creating objects at a location that can handle that responsibility, specifically at a class/interface level.

### Information Expert
Is responsible for delegating and giving each method, class, and object one single responsibility.

### Low Coupling
Not a promoted ideology, describes a program with a lot of dependencies, restricting it from being reusable.

### High Cohesion
All objects, classes and methods share and contribute to one goal and are not dependent on each other.

### Controller
Delegates how information is passed through classes, objects and essentially, the program.

###Indecision
Could be called the parent of a controller, isn't smart in itself but likes to have objects that are worthy of delegation.

### Polymorphism
Practicing inheritance, has different children and forms that work and provide different implementations.

### Protected Variation
Practicing immutability and protecting objects from complete exposure 

### Pure Fabrication
The program and IDE in itself breaking up complicated methods and extracting information from it to use elsewhere.
